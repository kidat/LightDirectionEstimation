Light Direction Estimation from Depth and Shadow

This project leverages MoGe for depth estimation and SSIS for object-shadow association to accurately estimate the direction of the light source present at the time of image capture.
Such light direction estimation can be valuable for applications including realistic scene relighting, photo editing, and inferring the time of day based on lighting conditions in the image.
